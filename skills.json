[https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database) - secondary source for any non-duplicate drinks CaffeineWiz uses [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to pull the tables from the websites above, then strips the html tags, and later formats the results into the comprehensive list.
